                <h4>Mechanisms of Action and Potential Side Effects</h4>
                <p>
                    Tablets for insomnia work through different mechanisms to induce sleep and alleviate aleep difficulties. <br>Some common mechanisms of action include:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>GABAergic modulation:</b> Certain insomnia tablets enhance the activity of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a neurotransmitter that inhibits brain activity and promotes relaxation, leading to sedation and sleep induction.</li>
                    <li><b>Melatonin regulation:</b> Melatonin agonists mimic the effects of the hormone melatonin, which regulates the sleep-wake cycle, helping to synchronize circadian rhythms and improve sleep onset and maintenance.</li>
                    <li><b>Serotonergic modulation:</b> Some tablets target sreotonin receptors in the brain, regulating mood and sleep-wake cycles to promote sleep.</li>
                    <li><b>Histamine antagonism:</b> Certain medications block histamine receptors, reducing wakefulness and promoting drowsiness.</li>
                </ol>

                    <li><b>Dizziness, lightheadedness, or coordination problems:</b> Picture standing up too quickly after taking your medication and feeling dizzy or experiencing lightheadedness that makes it challenging to navigate your surroundings safely. These symptoms can interfere with daily activities and increase the risk of accidents.</li>
                    <li><b>Gastrointestinal disturbances, such as nausea or constipation:</b> Consider the discomfort of experiencing nausea or constipation after taking an insomnia tablet, disrupting your morning routine and causing discomfort throughout the day. These gastrointestinal issues can add to the overall discomfort associated with sleep disturbances.</li>
                    <li><b>Paradoxical reactions, such as agitation, confusion, or hallucinations:</b> Imagine feeling more agitated or confused after taking medication intended to promote sleep, experiencing unsettling hallucinations that disrupt your sense of reality. These unexpected reactions can be distressing and may exacerbate existing sleep difficulties.</li>
                    <li><b>Risk of dependence or tolerance with prolonged use:</b> Think about the potential consequences of relying on insomnia for an extended period, gradually building tolerance and dependence on the medication to achieve sleep. This dependence can lead to challenges in discontinuing the medication and may require careful management under the guidance of a healthcare professional.</li>
                </ul>
